# Test App

#### Architecture

This project is designed using MVVM architecture. Since android framework adapts observer pattern in their views and the app is relatively small, MVVM is applied for simplicity but can be easily redesigned to Clean architecture.

#### Side Note

Since omitting "all" at the end of url yields the same response, this project removes it to utilize query parameter instead of path parameter.
